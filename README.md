Prework is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: James Lipe

Time spent: 5  hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- Adjustable tip slider allows customer to select a tip from 0% to 100%
- Setting screen allows cutsomer to select default tip

## Notes

It was hard to figure out how to keep the keyboard always showing. I also added functionality to remove the keyboard if a user taps the screen (not the slider). Leraning how the components were connected to the code in XCode was a little difficult as well.
